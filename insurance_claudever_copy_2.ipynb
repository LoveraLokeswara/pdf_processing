    "1. The question is about domestic physiotherapy coverage, so I searched the document for mentions of \"physiotherapy\".\n",
    "\n",
    "2. I found a section titled \"3.73 Physiotherapy\" that seems relevant. It states:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"If an Insured Person suffers an illness or accidental Injury that occurs during the policy Period and that Injury solely and directly requires the Insured Person to undergo physiotherapy, then we will reimburse the costs incurred on physiotherapy, up to a maximum of Sum Insured mentioned under this cover in certificate of insurance in excess of the co-pay/sub-limit, if any.\"\n",

    "3. This excerpt indicates physiotherapy is covered up to a certain Sum Insured amount mentioned in the certificate of insurance, subject to any co-pay or sub-limits. However, it does not specify the exact coverage amount.\n",
